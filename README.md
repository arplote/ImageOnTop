# ImageOnTop  
<img align="right" width="75" height="75" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arplote/ImageOnTop/master/ImageOnTop/logo2b.ico">
Small soft to display pictures on top of all windows.
  
  
  
  
## Use:
```
.\ImageOnTop.exe path\to\your\image
```

## Interactions:
### Move
- **Drag & drop** to move the image freely, or use **arrows** or **shift+arrows** to move on axis.
- Use **ctrl+arrows** to send the image on one side of the screen.
- You can also **swipe left of right** with two fingers to quickly send the image to one side of the screen.

### Zoom
- Two-finger **scroll** up and down
- Numkey **+** and **-**

## Convenient use:
### Combined with your screenshot tool
I personaly use it combined with [Greenshot](https://github.com/greenshot/greenshot).  
I take a screenshot of anything I want, Greenshot sends it to ImageOnTop, and the screenshot directly goes on top of all Windows.
